This is a simple implementation of the CONSTRUCT JSON idea
(http://steveharris.tumblr.com/post/4590579712/construct-json).

To install this code first edit settings.php to state what endpoint you with to
use, then copy settings.php, query.php, and sparql-xml-parse.php to an
appropriate place in your Apache deployment.
